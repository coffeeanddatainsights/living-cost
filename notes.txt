(1) OBJECTIVES : 
    - Identify the best places in the world to live, combining:
        - Housing costs (€/m² for buying and renting)
        - Cost of living (average monthly expenses: food, utilities, transport, leisure)
    - Focus on Italy: analyze which cities/regions offer the best balance between real estate costs and cost of living.
    - For Italy only: study real estate trends over time, both for:
        - Renting market (€/m² per month)
        - Buying market (€/m²)

! create visualizations and dashboards to communicate findings effectively. ! 


(2) GENERAL PIPELINE : 
    i   - Identify datasets and load that on table's database
    ii  - Extract data 
    iii - Clean data
    iv - Transform data
    v  - Load data 
    vi - Data Visualization

(3) COMPLETE PIPELINE : 
    3.1 -  Identify datasets and load that on table's database
        a. Identify different sources and different datasets to link all of that to one unique dataset -> raw dataset. 
        b. Create MySQL database where all of data are loaded.
        c. Based on raw dataset, create all of different tables, with all of right data types, and its relationships.
        d. Load data from raw dataset to created tables on (c) point.
    
    3.2 - Extract data
        a. Prepare python environment with all of requirements.
        b. Extract data from database with python scripts and sql queries.

    3.3 - Clean data
        a. Clean data from white spaces, duplicates, etc...
    
    3.4 - Transform data
        a. With python scripts add calculated columns for KPIs / Affordability Index that helps for the final objectives.
        b. Calculate initialized data that are useful for the KPIs
    
    3.5 - Load data
        a. Export data in a csv file
        b. Load data from csv file to power bi.
    
    3.6 - Data Visualization
        a. Worksheet 1 - World 
            - Card 1 : Mean cost of all of houses
            - Card 2 : €/m² for buying
            - Card 3 : €/m² for renting
            - Card 4 : Mean of total cost of living
            - Map 
            
        b. Worksheet 2 - Italy 
            - Card 1 : Mean cost of all of houses
            - Card 2 : €/m² for buying
            - Card 3 : €/m² for renting
            - Card 4 : Mean of total cost of living
            - Map 
              
! All steps are fully reproducible with Python scripts, SQL queries and Power-BI. !

(4) EXTRACT DATA :
    ! data are stored on € or $. On the table there's cost (numeric field, intended on monthly cost) and currency (€or $) !
